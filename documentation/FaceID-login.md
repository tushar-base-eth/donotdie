Here’s a short, simple summary of the "Adding Biometric" feature for your Next.js web app, using WebAuthn with resident keys. On iPhones, it’s labeled "Login with FaceID," and on other devices (e.g., Android), it’s "Login with Biometric." This integrates with your Supabase auth and middleware, removing the signup page and streamlining login.

### Summary: Adding Biometric Feature
- **Goal**: Enable passwordless login with FaceID (iPhone) or Biometric (other devices) via WebAuthn resident keys.
- **Login Page**: Two tabs: "Google" and "Login with FaceID/Biometric."
  - First time: Email field + button in the biometric tab.
  - Next time (session expired): Just a button, no email field.
- **Platforms**: Chrome and Safari (iOS, Android, etc.).
- **Flow**: First-time users enter email to register biometric, then use only their face/fingerprint thereafter.

### Simple Flow from User Side, Client/Browser, and Next.js Server

#### First Time (No Account)
1. **User**: 
   - Sees login page with "Google" and "Login with FaceID/Biometric" tabs.
   - Clicks biometric tab, enters email (e.g., `user@example.com`), clicks "Login with FaceID/Biometric."
   - Scans face (FaceID on iPhone, Biometric on Android).
   - Redirected to `/home`.
2. **Client/Browser**: 
   - Shows email field + button in biometric tab.
   - Sends email to server, gets WebAuthn registration options.
   - Triggers `navigator.credentials.create()` with `residentKey: "required"`.
   - Scans face, sends credential to server.
3. **Next.js Server**: 
   - Checks email; if new, creates Supabase user with random password.
   - Sends WebAuthn options (resident key enabled).
   - Receives credential, stores it in `user_credentials` table with `user_id`.
   - Logs user into Supabase, redirects to `/home`.

#### Next Time (Session Expired)
1. **User**: 
   - Sees login page, clicks "Login with FaceID/Biometric" tab.
   - Sees only a "Login with FaceID/Biometric" button (no email field).
   - Clicks button, scans face, redirected to `/home`.
2. **Client/Browser**: 
   - Detects resident key support, hides email field.
   - Calls `navigator.credentials.get()` with minimal options.
   - Scans face, retrieves `user_id` from resident key, sends to server.
3. **Next.js Server**: 
   - Receives credential with `user_id`, verifies with stored public key.
   - Logs user into Supabase using stored password.
   - Redirects to `/home`.

#### Session Alive
1. **User**: 
   - Opens app, goes straight to `/home` (no login page).
2. **Client/Browser**: 
   - Middleware checks session, redirects.
3. **Next.js Server**: 
   - Middleware (`middleware.ts`) sees valid Supabase session, skips login.

### Key Points
- **Label**: "Login with FaceID" on iPhone, "Login with Biometric" elsewhere.
- **Resident Keys**: Stores `user_id` on device, skips email after first use.
- **Supabase**: Creates account first time, uses random password internally.
- **Middleware**: Keeps session-alive redirect to `/home` as-is.

This keeps it simple and seamless for users across devices!
